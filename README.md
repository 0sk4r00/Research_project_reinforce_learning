# Research project reinforce learning

Project shows comparison of 4 algorithms (ppo, dqn, reinforce, actor-critic) in gymnasium environment.

## Used libraries
 - pytorch 2.5.1
 - gymnasium 1.0.0
 - numpy 1.26.4
 - pandas 2.2.2
 - matplotlib 3.8.4
 - seaborn 0.13.2
 - cuda 12.4.1

 ## Launch algorithms
 Each algorithm is in a separate folder, this is started by running notepad. Than put csv files in results folder. Run `train_graphs.ipynb` to draw training (exploration) graphs.
 Run `evaluation_graphs.ipynb` to draw test (evaluation) graphs.
